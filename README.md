2d game inspired by Games like Raid:SL, and Vampire Survivors, and Naval Ops: Commander.

# Gameplay
Player ship automatically flies towards a stronghold, fighting off attacks the whole time. Player prepares for the fight by equipping weapons and upgrades to the ship before battle. During the battle the player gives orders to the ship, such as how fast to go (as waves are endless going slower will result in more enemies fought off total, and possibly a more well defended stronghold, but the ship doesn't have to fight off enemies as quickly. Some obstacles may be better tacked with speed, while others may be safer if done slowly.) The player can also give turrets general targeting orders, such as changing targeting preference weights between target distance, how far off the turret's current point of aim the target is, and target size. The player may also give targeting orders per enemy type, such as which sizes of turrets should target or ignore it. After each stronghold is defeated the player may choose a "Field Modification", giving the ship some bonus for the remainder of the run, and will also receive some currency, and/or some equipment (new guns, upgrades, turrets?) which will persist between battles and can be used to permanently upgrade the player's ship.

# The Fun
The enjoyment of the game comes from equipping and upgrading an increasingly powerful main ship, possibly with escorts, watching the ship fight through increasingly powerful waves of enemies using player given orders, and trying to get the best possible run using field upgrades to overcome increasingly unfair odds.

Visual spectacle.

Side Game? Ammo factory? Pay for ammo?

# Enemy Ideas
Suicide drone. Basically a missile of various sizes.
Drone carrier. Makes and releases other drones.

# Gun Ideas
Gun types:
- Kinetic (standard gun that fires bullets, explosives, shotgun etc.)
- Laser (Beam or burst)
- Plasma (Compressed shockwave type gun that loses damage but increases spread over time)
- Gravity?
- Effector

# Ammo Ideas
Kinetic:
- Bullet
- Shotgun
- Sabot
- Explosive
- Nuclear (Subcategory of explosive? But radiation instead of compression/shrapnel, which gives interesting new possibilites)

# Missile Ideas

# Fusing Ideas
Explosives:
- Contact (Default)
- Penetrating (Higher damage, but will overpenetrate small targets)
- Proximity (Straight upgrade to contact, maybe slightly lower damage?)
